	"desc": "Overloads javascript objects with <code>pushctx()</code> and <code>popctx()</code> functions. They can be used to create derived objects overloaded with a context stack. This module also exports a <code>console()</code> function that can be used to wrap any console-like object in context stack which will be printed as a prefix to any log line.",
	"usage": "We use this library to create super readable and easy to read logs for our distributed system. Each log line contains a context stack that can be used to track down flows across processes and servers.",
